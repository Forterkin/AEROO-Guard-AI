# AEROO-Guard AI

AI system for early detection of forest fires using satellite imagery.

## Problem
Forest fires are often detected too late, causing massive environmental and economic damage.

## Solution
We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically classify satellite images and detect fire-prone areas.

## MVP
- Upload satellite image
- AI predicts: Fire / No Fire
- Probability score

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Streamlit

## Future Work
- Fire segmentation
- Real-time satellite data integration
